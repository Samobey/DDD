    "This notebook demonstrates how to implement long-term episodic memory using embeddings and vector search.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts:\n",
    "- **Episodic memory**: Stores specific events, experiences, and interactions with temporal context\n",
    "- **Episodes**: Complete narratives of what happened, when, and the outcome\n",
    "- **Time-aware retrieval**: Retrieve past events relevant to current context\n",
    "- **Sequential memory**: Preserves the order and relationship between events\n",
    "- **Contextual recall**: Access rich details about specific moments in history"

    "## Key Takeaways: Long-Term Episodic Memory Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it Works:\n",
    "1. **Extract**: Specific events and experiences are extracted from user messages\n",
    "2. **Timestamp**: Events are timestamped to preserve temporal context\n",
    "3. **Store**: Rich episode narratives are stored in the vector database\n",
    "4. **Retrieve**: Relevant past experiences are retrieved based on current context\n",
    "5. **Contextualize**: Episodes augment the agent's understanding of the user's journey\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics:\n",
    "- ✅ Remembers specific events with full context\n",
    "- ✅ Preserves temporal information (when things happened)\n",
    "- ✅ Retrieves semantically similar experiences\n",
    "- ✅ Better than semantic memory for narrative understanding\n",
    "- ✅ Helps agent understand cause-and-effect relationships\n",
    "- ❌ More verbose than semantic memory (longer storage)\n",
    "- ❌ Requires event extraction logic\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences from Semantic Memory:\n",
    "| Aspect | Semantic | Episodic |\n",
    "|--------|----------|----------|\n",
    "| **Content** | Facts and knowledge | Events and experiences |\n",
    "| **Temporal** | Timeless | Time-aware |\n",
    "| **Context** | What is known | What happened and when |\n",
    "| **Use case** | General knowledge | Personal history |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Use Cases:\n",
    "- Personal diary or journal assistant\n",
    "- Mentoring systems tracking student progress\n",
    "- Customer service with interaction history\n",
    "- Project management tracking milestones\n",
    "- Therapy or coaching with session notes"
